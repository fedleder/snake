It is a simple snake game made in c++ with SFML library.
It isn't already finished, i'm working for sounds, points display and other little things.
This is my first c++ project so probably the code isn't good, but I've done the possible.

I took the idea from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApgMNAApdR4&t=90s).
